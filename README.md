<p></p>
Hello! Throughout the years, I've been almost completely a self-taught programmer. My study focus is programming but I need to mention I have a huge respect for mathematics and physics. In the programming world, my passion is game programming but to be honest, I have no problem at all creating other types of software not related to the video game industry. I'm open to work 100% remotely (worldwide) so, feel free to contact me, hopefully we can build great things together.
